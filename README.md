# MGWR_HIV
Code for MGWR analysis on HIV.  
- The visualization on variables for HIV is at /MGWR_notebooks/MGWR_HIV_visualization.ipynb, which contains all the maps for different variables on how they correlate with HIV cases. Currently the notebook can only run on google colab, which I will add more instructions on. I might do some work to see if I fix the errors I had when I run it in jupyter notebook.
- The output from running the MGWR software can be found at /MGWR_output.
